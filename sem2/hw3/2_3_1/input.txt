In a tiny house in the North Countrie far away from any town or village there lived not long ago a poor widow all alone with her little son
The housedoor opened straight on to the hillside and all round about were moorlands and huge stones and swampy hollows never a house nor a sign of life wherever you might look for their nearest neighbours were the ferlies in the glen below and the willthewisps in the long grass along the pathside
And many a tale she could tell of the good folk calling to each other in the oaktrees and the twinkling lights hopping on to the very window-sill on dark nights but in spite of the loneliness she lived on from year to year in the little house perhaps because she was never asked to pay any rent for it
But she did not care to sit up late when the fire burnt low and no one knew what might be about so when they had their supper she would make up a good fire and go off to bed so that if anything terrible did happen she could always hide her head under the bedclothes
This however was far too early to please her little son so when she called him to bed he would go on playing beside the fire as if he did not hear her
He had always been bad to do with since the day he was born and his mother did not often care to cross him indeed the more she tried to make him obey her the less heed he paid to anything she said so it usually ended by his taking his own way
